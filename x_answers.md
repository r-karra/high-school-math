## 🧮 1. Sets — Venn Diagram Application

**Given:**
- Total students = 60
- |M| = 32 (Mathematics)
- |S| = 28 (Science)
- |M ∩ S| = 18 (Both subjects)

**To Find:** Students who like *only* Mathematics.

We use:
$$[
|M \text{ only}| = |M| - |M \cap S|
\]$$

$$[
|M \text{ only}| = 32 - 18 = 14
\]$$

**Answer:**
$$[
\boxed{14 \text{ students like only Mathematics.}}
\]$$

## 🧮 2. Trigonometry — Heights & Distances

**Question:**
If the angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point 30 m away is 45°, find the height of the tower.

**Solution:**
$$[
\tan 45° = \frac{h}{30} = 1
\]$$

$$[
h = 30 \, m
\]$$

**Answer:**
$$[
\boxed{\text{Height = 30 m}}
\]$$

## 🧮 3. Quadratic Equations — Nature of Roots

Solve the quadratic equation:
$$[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
\]$$

**Factorize:**
$$[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3) = 0
\]$$

**Roots:**
$$[
x = 2, \quad x = 3
\]$$

**Nature of Roots:** Real & Distinct.

## 🧮 4. Tangents & Secants — Power of a Point

**Question:**
From an external point P, two tangents are drawn to a circle touching at A and B. Prove that PA = PB.

**Proof:**
Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

Given: PA and PB are tangents from point P.

We know:
$$[
PA^2 = PB^2 \Rightarrow PA = PB
\]$$

**Answer:**
$$[
\boxed{\text{PA and PB are equal.}}
\]$$
